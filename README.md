# R-Custom plots
Inside each folder you'll find scripts for creating different types of plots using R programming language. Click over each figure or directly over the directory.  

List of plots:  
> **Linear model plot**: with confidence interval and boostrap statistics.  
> **Boxplot with density**: A modified boxplot with each observation plotted as points and a density histogram.  
> **Lines plot**: or spaguetti plot where x values are the variables that describe the same object.  
> **Heatmap**: A matrix of values represented with colors.  
> **Custom Colormaps**: Useful tips for the creation of custom color palettes  
> **Stacked barplot**: Code for a stacked barplot all from scratch, no ggplot.   
> **Dendrograms** :Tree diagram that ilustrates the arregement of clusters.  
> **Multi Dimensional Scaling**: Comming soon!
